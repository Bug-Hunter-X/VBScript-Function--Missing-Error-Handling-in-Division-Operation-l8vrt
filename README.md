This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: the absence of error handling in a function that performs division. The `bug.vbs` file contains the faulty code, while `bugSolution.vbs` shows the corrected version with proper error handling.  The bug is the lack of checks to prevent division by zero or attempting to divide by a non-numeric type. This can lead to runtime errors and application crashes. The solution adds `On Error Resume Next` and checks the type and value of `param2` to prevent the errors.
